Uses Monte Carlo methods (or Monte Carlo experiments), which are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on 
repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results.

Black Hole is a two-player strategy game where each player starts with 10 tiles numbered 1 through 10.
The number on the tiles represent both their values and the order in which they must be placed onto a triangular board. 
The board has 21 spaces so one space remains uncovered. Once all the tiles have been placed, the tiles that surround the 
empty space are sucked into the black hole. The objective of the game is to have fewer points sucked into the black hole 
(so you have the higher overall score remaining on the board) than the other player.

This implementation is Human vs Computer. In order to make computer take intelligent moves Monte Carlo method is employed.

Further improvement:
Minmax algorithm to be implemented in the last few rounds to make accurate move by evaluating all options and not on randomness.
